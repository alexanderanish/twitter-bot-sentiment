# TwitterBot

Code Repo for playing with the tweepy library

In this example I use a list of stock symbols to tweet polls based on trending stock and crypto tickers in Wallstreetbets Sentiment analysis on posts with these ticker values.


##ideas for how to manage ticker polls

1. Run get top 20 from reddit everyday
2. append to databse everyday and remove duplicates
3. take total count and divide by 5 = number of tweets (polls) for the day
4. look up tickers from last 5 days (tweeted polls)
5. 

always tweet 9:15am eastern time
