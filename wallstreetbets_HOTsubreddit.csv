1) On a Friday afternoon at 2:30 pm, the parking lot was only 1/8 full

2) There was no valet at the parking lot.  I had to leave my car by the big menu and microphone.  Seemed like some cars were just as frustrated as they started honking.

3) There was no one taking tickets to get into the playground area.  Anyone could have gotten for free.

4) The restaurant had a grand total of 22 people in it.   Only 2 of which looked homeless.

5) The Big Mac and Fries were $6 together.  It‚Äôs so much cheaper to kill the cow and cook the burger yourself.

This is a doomed business unless something drastically changes.  People are cooking burgers for cheaper.  Big Mac numbers are way down maybe i don‚Äôt really know.

I will be surprised if McDonalds is still around by 2022.

Apes be careful with this one.

&nbsp;

Pretty no brainer trade tbh, only two scenarios can occur, both of which benefit Amazon.

&nbsp;

**Scenario 1 : Successful Space Flight**

This is the most likely outcome. The flight is good, and $AMZN rallies cause people are stupid as hell and don't realize that Bezos has nothing to do with Amazon anymore. Also the market has been red for 3 days straight and JPow wont allow that to happen so tomorrow will be green regardless. 

&nbsp;

**Scenario 2 : The Rocket Ships Blows Up In a Big Fiery Inferno Ball of Death**

This scenario may initially come across as bearish, but is actually the complete opposite. With Bezos dying, 30% of Amazon's entire float would vanish into thin air since he controls most shares. A dead guy cant sell his shares, so we could technically treat this event as a giant 1 Trillion dollar $AMZN stock buyback, which would happen instantly. Bezos dying in a rocket explosion would wipe out a large chunk of Amazons outstanding shares. Insanely bullish.

We are also at the absolute 0 of our Fibonacci levels. This is the last level of support

Current estimates say we should be reaching the 42 dollar level in the short term for a retest of the .618 fib level.

1. On a Saturday night at 7:00 pm while some new popular movies are out the parking lot was about 1/8 full.

2. There was no one working the box office selling tickets, you could only buy tickets from the automated machine, there were two of these machines and one was out of printer paper so you couldn‚Äôt use it.

3. There was no one taking tickets to get into the theater, AT ALL, you literally could have just walked into any movie carrying anything.

4. The 7:00 movie we saw had a grand total of 22
People in it.

5. The tickets with tax were 24$ and a regular popcorn and regular soda was 15$, so nearly 40$ for two people to go to a movie (cheaper to stream it from home)

This is a doomed business unless something drastically changes. People are streaming from home for cheaper.  Black widow box office numbers are way down because of streaming.

I will
Be surprised if AmC still exist in a couple years 

Apes be careful!! The fundamentals may still be there for a big squeeze, but get in, make some money and get out.

Down vote me, call me a hedgie fud spreader whatever you gotta do, I‚Äôm just telling you unemotional observations.

I bought in at 10$ and sold 75% of my shares at 60$ but am still holding.


Be careful smooth brained apes‚Ä¶."
